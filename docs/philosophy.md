# Project Philosophy

Tram is designed to help everyday developers who are new to Clojure start building web applications.

There are other web frameworks for Clojure, but they are not designed 
to cater to folks who are not already in the ecosystem.  Tram aims to 
welcome new people into the Clojure community. 

To that end, there are a few things that are less typical of common
Clojure projects.  My guideline is that if it would help somebody who 
is more familiar with a JS framework like Next, or another framework like
Rails, it's probably a good fit for Tram. 

It's my hope that experienced Clojure programmers will also enjoy using Tram.  
I like writing Clojure, which is why I started this project, and hopefully other
people who like it will find it useful. 

## Beginner Friendliness
It's nobody's fault, but I do not find Clojure to be particularly
beginner friendly in a lot of instances.  This project aims to make you learn
a minimal number of things before you can get started.  A starter project 
makes sure you can get going immediately, and guidebooks will help you 
figure out what to do and where.
