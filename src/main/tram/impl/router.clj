(ns tram.impl.router
  "Routing has a somewhat complected structure to make it easy to use, and so here
  are some terms to keep things consistent.

  - view: function that returns hiccup and takes locals.
  - handler: function that takes a request and returns a response.
  - handler-spec: map with a :handler key and possibly more metadata.
  - handler-entry: value for a method key.  Either a handler-spec, a handler, or a keyword for a view.
  - method: one of #{:get :post :put :patch :delete :options}.
  - route: map of behavior tied to a single url.  Routes are named by a :name key.

  In the following exampled:

  [\"foo\" {:name :route/foo
            :get get-foo
            :post {:handler create-foo
                   :parameters {:body FooParams}}]

  :get and :post are methods.
  get-foo and create-foo are handlers.

  {:handler create-foo
   :parameters {:body FooParams}}
  and
  get-foo

  are handler-entries.

  The second element of the vector is a route.  Note that it has a name."
